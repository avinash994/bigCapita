As per the guidance, taxpayers whose annual service tax payment (including cash and cenvat) was Rs 30 million or more in the preceding financial year may be subjected to mandatory audit each year. It is preferable that audit of all such units is done by using computer assisted audit program (CAAP) techniques. The frequently of audit for other taxpayers would be as per following norms:.</p>
                                                                        <p>i. Taxpayers with service tax payment above Rs 30 million (cash+ cenvat) (mandatory units) to be audited every year.<br />

                                                                            iii. Taxpayers with service tax payment between 2.5 million and 10 million (cash + cenvat) to be audited once every five year.<br />
                                                                            iv. Taxpayers with service tax payment up to 2.5 million (cash + cenvat) 2% of taxpayers to be audited every year.</p>
                                                                        <p>The audit selection guidelines, therefore would apply to the non-mandatory taxpayers, forming part of discretionary workload. These taxpayers should be selected on the basis of assessment of risk potential to the revenue. This process, which is an essential feature of audit selection, is known as Risk Assessment. It involves the ranking of taxpayers according to quantitative indicators of risk known as a “risk parameter”. It is also suggested that the taxpayers whose returns were selected for detailed scrutiny, the taxpayers who have been selected for audit, may not be taken up for detailed scrutiny of their ST-3 returns during that year.</p>

In fact rule 5 of the services tax rules, 1994 provides that the records including computerized data as maintained by an assessees in accordance with the various laws in force from time to time shall be acceptable to the Department. Accordingly, service tax assessees who are joint stock companies governed by the provisions of Companies Act, 2013 will maintain books/ accounts as prescribed under the Companies Act, 2013. Assessees who are registered under the Co-operative Societies Act or under the Societies Registration Act will maintain books/records under the respective rules/regulations framed under the laws governing the assessees. Similarly, assesses who are registered as Trust will maintain books/accounts as required of them under the law governing the trust, if any. Assessees who are receiving foreign contributions will maintain books/records specially required of them as prescribed under the Foreign Contributions Regulation Act /rules framed thereunder. Similarly sole traders and partnership firms will maintain accounts/books as required under the income tax /sales tax acts including work contracts and also as required under the Tax Audit rules under the Income Tax Act 1961 besides records under other tax laws and special statutes such as Insurance Laws, Banking Laws and Rules and Regulations framed thereunder.

Similarly the record maintained by the insurance company providing life/general insurance will be different from the records maintained by consignment agent of goods. In fact, in the case of such service providers such as stock brokers, life insurance companies, general insurance companies etc. there are special statutes governing their set up and operation and under these statutes they are required to maintain certain special type of records.</p>

Similarly, service, rendered by a government, services rendered by constitutional authority/body, Member of Parliament, members of legislative assembly and services provided by an employee to the employer pursuant to a contractual employment are not within the scope of services. However, where a person works as an independent contractor where the relationship is one of contract for service, service tax will be attracted eg., a manpower supply services provider will be under contract for service and not contract of service. Similarly an AMC provider who is acting as an independent contractor will be providing service under contract for service. These are liable to service tax.<br />
